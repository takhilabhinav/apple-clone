# Apple Clone
An Apple Clone website built with HTML, SCSS and JavaScript

## Lessons Learned
I realised how many problems you can face by building a template exactly the way it looks, however, I thoroughly enjoyed solving all the little issues I faced and overall was happy with the outcome.

## challenges I faced
My biggest challenge was getting the transition of the mobile menu button to be identical to the real Apple mobile menu button. I overcame this by researching more on cubic-bezier and incorporating my own reverse animations for when the menu is closed.

Another issue I had was with getting the image sizes the same as they show on Apple, I eventually overcame this by setting a specific background-size for each image which required me to essentially play around with the numbers for each one until I got it right and then also do the same for them on different screen sizes.

## Features Included
* animation
* mobile menu will falling, revealing nav list
* paid specific attention to small detail
* footer responsive dropdown list
* fully responsive

## Ways To Improve
* To Improve this, I would add functionality to the search bar in the mobile menu so users could search for items of interest. I would also buy the Pro Display font Apple uses as I did not have that equipment to work with.
